To do list
==========

High priority
-------------

-	string to int/rat/float conversion
-	file IO
-	spaces
-	unicode support

Low priority
------------

-	threading
-	do-while loop

	Instead of regular do-while loop, we allow the while anywhere in the loop, like

	do [ stuff ] while( condition ) [ stuff ]
-	function overloading
-	operator overloading for spaces
-	template-like functions with the `any' keyword
-	alternative for pointers
